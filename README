This is an AS3 mathematics library that supports expression parsing and evaluation. It gets hacked about whenever we need it for a new application, but at core it support Complex and Real valued expressions. We'd like to extend it so support Fractions and Sets - indeed there's a fair amount of Set membership code in there. The parser accepts what I call 'email maths'. So you can say things like:

var z:Complex = new Expression('sin(pi/3)^2+cos(pi/3)^(2)').evaluate();

and hope that z now takes the value Complex(1).

Look in Expression.as for a description of the grammar, and look in org.maths.tests for the flexunit tests.
